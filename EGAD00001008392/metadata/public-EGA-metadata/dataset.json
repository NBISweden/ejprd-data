{"accession_id":"EGAD00001008392","title":"Rare Disease Synthetic Dataset","description":"The purpose of this project is to provide public human datasets for the study of rare diseases. The use of public human genomic background combined with the in-silico insertion of real disease-causing variants enable to have a representative dataset for testing purposes without facing ethical and legal issues associated with the use of human sensitive data. This project aims to help development of technical implementations for rare disease data integration, analysis, discovery,  and federated access.","dataset_types":["Genomic variant calling","Phenotype information","Whole genome sequencing"],"technologies":["Illumina HiSeq 2000"],"num_samples":18,"access_type":"controlled","extra_attributes":null,"is_in_beacon":false,"is_released":true,"released_date":"2001-01-01T01:00:00+01:00","is_deprecated":false,"policy_accession_id":"EGAP00001002395","submission_accession_id":"EGA00002148179","created_at":"2021-12-01T11:53:53+01:00","edited_at":"2021-12-02T15:43:54+01:00"}
