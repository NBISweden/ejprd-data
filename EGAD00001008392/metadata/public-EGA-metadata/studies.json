It consists of 18 whole genomes (6 index cases with their parents) which have genetic background based on public human data sequenced in the context of the Illumina Platinum initiative (Eberle, MA et al. (2017)) and made available by the HapMap project (https://www.genome.gov/10001688/international-hapmap-project).
